#### 4.1. General Prohibitions

You agree not to post, upload, or share any UGC that:

- (a) Is illegal, or promotes or facilitates illegal activities.

#### 4.2. Specific Prohibitions for Shared Prompts and AI-Related Content

As a platform for responsible prompt engineering, you are strictly prohibited from sharing any content, especially prompts, that falls into the following categories:

- **(a) Prompts for Bypassing AI Safeguards:** You may not publish or distribute prompts that are explicitly designed or marketed to circumvent, disable, or bypass the safety filters and ethical guidelines of third-party AI platforms (e.g., text, image, or code generation services). Sharing techniques or specific wording intended to force other platforms to produce content that violates their policies (such as hateful, violent, or sexually explicit material) is forbidden.
- **(b) Distribution of "Jailbreak" Prompts:** You may not use the Platform to share or distribute "jailbreak" prompts. This refers to any prompt or sequence of prompts engineered to coerce a third-party AI model into violating its core operational constraints or ethical programming. Our platform must not be used to disseminate exploitation techniques for other AI services.
- **(c) Prompts for Malicious or Illegal Content Generation:** You are prohibited from sharing prompts that are explicitly designed to instruct a third-party AI to generate content intended to deceive, harm, or facilitate illegal acts. This includes sharing prompts for creating misinformation, generating malicious code (malware, viruses), writing content for phishing schemes, or producing fraudulent documents.
- **(d) Disrespect for the AI Ecosystem:** AI Cookbook exists within a larger ecosystem of AI development and use. You agree not to share any content that encourages or directly facilitates the violation of the terms of service or acceptable use policies of any third-party AI provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Midjourney). Promoting methods to abuse other services is a violation of our own Terms.
